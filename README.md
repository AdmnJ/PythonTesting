# Python Testing
## Learning Python
	As the title suggests this is a repository for me to place
	files, notes, code, ect. as I attempt to learn python. While 
	Not my first programming language however it is common for my
	first attempts at a language to be exceedingly basic in nature.
	I often follow tutorials or basic guides and often and make a 
	number of mistakes. However flawed I do like to hold onto the
	first bits of code I make in a new language as a point of 
	reference as well as a sort of snippet library I can look back 
	at in the future.


### Just tell me what I will see in this repo...  
1. Code resulting from following various tutorials
	+ Will try to credit them here
2. Sometimes Strange or Niche code.
3. Likely many mistakes
	* Code here is and will be highly disposable and thus if it has not branched out into it's one project it will likely not be updated.
4. Maybe some class work.
    + Going to take a class in Python in the coming semester so I may add some of that work here. (No promises though)

#### Tutorials Followed From...
